            Getting back home after a hospital stay can be tough. Hospitals are built for patient accessibility.
            You may not even realize what some quality-of-life items you need until you get home. One of the goals we laid out when we opened our Medical Equipment Showroom
            was to make it easy for customers to get what they need. One way of doing this is offering rentals on top of purchases.

            <strong>How to Know if You Should Rent or Buy Medical Equipment</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some surgeries and procedures have short recovery times. Some are the exact opposite. And a few will leave you with a lifelong need for certain assistance.
            Short-term recovery periods (1-2 weeks) can almost always get by with equipment rentals. There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a product you will only use for a few weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long-term recovery periods (2 weeks +) are a bit trickier. When you look at recovery aids or mobility aids for a longer period, the buyout price vs. rental price
            becomes a big question. Electric or motorized medical equipment (mobility scooters or power lift recliners) can be very expensive!
        </p>
        <p>
            A simplified way of looking at long-term mobility needs is as follows: If you are going to need a manually operated mobility item for over a month, purchasing is usually better.
            If you are going to need a motorized or electric item, rental usually makes more sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lifelong needs usually require purchase, however there are situations where rentals will make sense. If you are going on vacation or to an all-day event, rentals can be big money savers!
