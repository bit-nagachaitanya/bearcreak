    <div class="date">13 Nov, 2017•</div>

    <img src="~/images/blog2.png" alt="blog2 image loading" />
    <p>
        <strong>Anyone can make one:</strong>
        For better or worse, anyone can write a blog post about anything they want. Everyone has a voice and the best voices will rise to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The writer can show their personality:</strong>
        In blog posts, the writer has more leeway to add in their voice and personality than other types of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Blogs are a great form of mass communication:</strong>
        You can help people, learn new things, entertain your audience—the possibilities are endless and amazing. Blogging opens up all of these to a very wide audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>You can make money:</strong>
        Get the right blog going and you can make a lot of money through advertising and sponsored posts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>It allows people to craft better thoughts:</strong>
        Instead of reading haphazard, uneducated Facebook statuses, it's much better to see people's thought process in a well-written blog post.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>You can establish a community:</strong>
        Blogging allows you to connect with other individuals who share the same interests. Sharing ideas and opinions within your community helps establish yourself as a thought leader.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Good for SEO:</strong>
        Keeping content on your site fresh and relevant, you can use your blog to boost the search engine ranking (SEO) of your site and your business.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>It brings people back to your site:</strong>
        If your blog is strong enough and updated regularly, people will come back looking for more and bring traffic back to your site as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>It's free:</strong>
        It costs you a grand total of zero dollars to post to the blog, so if you have something to say, there's nothing to stop you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>You can establish yourself as a thought leader:</strong>
        A blog is a great place for your original thoughts, and it can be a wonderful way to show off your individuality. If people like your ideas, you can become a thought leader in your industry!
